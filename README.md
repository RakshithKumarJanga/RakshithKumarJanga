# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm **Rakshith Kumar Janga**, a Senior Control Algorithm Engineer working in the Automotive Industry.  
I have **7+ years of professional experience** in the design, development, and implementation of **Powertrain Control Algorithms** for HEV/BEV programs, as well as **Engine Performance Modelling**.  

Driven by curiosity about how machines make decisions, I also explored **Robotics** and **Embedded Control Systems**, building systems that integrate control, perception, and real-time decision-making.
